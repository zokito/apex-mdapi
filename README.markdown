Apex Wrapper Salesforce Metadata API
====================================

**[Deploy to Salesforce](https://githubsfdeploy.herokuapp.com/app/githubdeploy/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi)**

**Update: 27th October 2013:**
- A new introduction to the API has been published [here](http://andyinthecloud.com/2013/10/27/introduction-to-calling-the-metadata-api-from-apex/)
- A new supporting Visualforce example has also been created to show how to use apex:actionPoller

**Update: 30th August 2013:**
- Very interesting fix for the 'delete' CRUD operation (for fields), see this StackExchange [answer](http://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/15902/how-to-dynamically-set-type-x-value-for-metadata-customfield/15913#15913) for more and the MetadataServiceExamples.deleteField method

**Update: 20th June 2013:**
- Updated to **Summer'13 Metadata API (v28.0)**, more cool stuff to follow on this, such an Apex package installer UI!

**Update: 6th May 2013:**
- Updated MetadataCreateJob.cls, new feature to process Metadata API requests in Batch Apex, see examples.

**Update: 5th May 2013:**
- Updated MetadataServiceTest.cls, now provides 100% code coverage of MetadataService.cls!

**Update: 10th March 2013:**
- Updated to **Spring'13 Metadata API (v27.0)**, more info on new features of this version [here](http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Spring13/Bulk+Metadata+and+Streaming+API+Updates). Also added new samples for Settings configuraiton, see blog [here](http://andyinthecloud.com/2013/03/10/apex-metadata-api-spring13-update-org-settings-access).

**Update: 3rd March 2013:**
- Updated MetadataServiceExample.cls with more sample code creating various field types.

**Update: 11th November 2012:**
- Updated the Retrieve Demo to utilise 'describeMetadata' API call to allow the user to select which Metadata Type to list and retrieve.
- Added 'Metadata Explore' demo (see below) a Sencha powered demo of 'describeMetadata' and 'listMetadata' API's


Known Issues and Resolutions
----------------------------

- If you recieve the error message *'Insufficient access; cannot execute Metadata operation with PAC enabled session id'* within Apex code within a managed package utilising this library. Please ensure to changed the API access from Restricted to Unrestricted on your Package defintion. Many thanks to the great work from [vipulpahwa](https://github.com/vipulpahwa) and [Daniel Blackhall](https://github.com/seeflat) to getting to the bottom of this rather cryptic error message.

Introduction 
------------

There is a good blog entry providing an introduction to this library [here](http://andyinthecloud.com/2013/10/27/introduction-to-calling-the-metadata-api-from-apex/)

Background and Motivation
-------------------------

There seems to be a growing number of Apex developers wanting to develop solutions or just handy utils that embrace the declarative nature of the platform. Including those in FinancialForce.com for that matter! Such solutions are dynamically adapting to custom fields or objects that need to be created by the administrator and/or customisations to objects in existing packages.

As adminstrators leverage more and more of these solutions the topic of automation arrises. Can the developers of these solutions help the adminstrator by implementing wizards or self configuring solutions without asking the adminstrator to create these manually and then have to reference them back into the solution?

Strategies
----------

Salesforce provides a great number of API's for developers to consume, both off and on platform (as Apex developers). If you happen to be off platform (say in Heroku) and developing code to help automate adminstration. Then you can utilise the Salesforce Metadata API (via the Salesforce WebService Connector) to help with this. It is a robust and readily available API for creating objects, fields, pages and many other component types.

While Salesforce offer on platform Apex developers a means to query some of this information (a subset of the Metadata API coverage) via Apex Describe. It does not as yet provide a means to manipulate this metadata from Apex natively. We are told this is in the pipeline though I am personally not aware of when this will arrive.

So what can we do in the meantime as Apex developers? Well it turns out that Apex is quite good at making outbound calls to Web Services and more recently REST base API's, all be it as always with a few governors to be aware. So why can Apex not call out to the Metadata Web Services API? After all, there is a WSDL for it and you have the ability as an Apex developer to import a WSDL into Apex and consume the code it generates to make the call, right? Well...

Problems and Solutions
----------------------

Salesforce have been promoting recently the Metadata REST API. While this is still not a native API to Apex, it would be a lot easier to call than the Web Service one, though you would have develop your own wrapper classes. Unfortunatly this API is still in pilot and I have been told by Salesforce its appearance as a GA API is still someway out, sadly.

So you can download the Metadata WSDL from the Tools page under the Develop menu. If you attempt to use it directly (at version 25) you will encounter a number of issues before you can get the resulting Apex class to even compile. Getting it to then make a valid Metadata API call is then another task. 

The main reasons are as follows...

* The port name uses a reserved word, Metadata.
* Some operation names, such as create and update are also reserved words.
* The WSDL2Apex tool does not support polymorphic XML and the Metadata WSDL contains types that extend each other, e.g. CustomObject extends Metadata
* The Apex XML serialiser does not support inheritance (see above point). More specifically it does not see base class members nor does it emit the 'xsi:type' attribute to support polymorphic XML data binding. So the generated Apex code requires a bit of tweaking to support this.
* The Apex language does not support the Zip file format, so the **retrieve** and the **deploy** operations so these are a no go from a pure Apex perspective. However this doesnt stop the of Javascript to handle zips! See sections below on how this has been done.
* Most operations return **AsyncResult** which gives you an Id to call back on to determine the fate of your request. While this can be called, you will need to do this via AJAX, Apex Future or Apex Job. The deploy and retrieve samples utilise apex:actionPoller.

So once these issues are resolved we can now get access to the Metadata API from Apex!

* The following so called CRUD operations are useable within Apex, **create**, **update** and **delete**. 
* As well as **listMetadata** and **describeMetadata**. 
* You can also call **checkStatus** to check the status of your requests. 
* With a bit of help from a Javascript library, the infamous **retrieve** and **deploy** also become workable.

**Note:** The CRUD operations do not support Apex Class or Apex Trigger components sadly, this is a API restriction and not an issue with calling from Apex as such.

So I've created this Github repo to capture a modified version of the generated Apex class around the Metadata API. Which addresses the problems above. So that you can download it and get started straight away. Be warned though I have only performed tweaks to some of the more popular component types. I am more than happy if others want to contribute tweaks to others!

Examples
--------

**NOTE:** The following examples do not show how to call the checkStatus method. This will need to be done in your Visualforce controller via a timed refresh or via a scheduled job. See the following Retrieve and Deploy demos for how to use apex:actionPoller for this or the Batch Apex demo.

	public static void createObject()
	{
		MetadataService.MetadataPort service = createService();		
		MetadataService.CustomObject customObject = new MetadataService.CustomObject();
		customObject.fullName = 'Test__c';
		customObject.label = 'Test';
		customObject.pluralLabel = 'Tests';
		customObject.nameField = new MetadataService.CustomField();
		customObject.nameField.type_x = 'Text';
		customObject.nameField.label = 'Test Record';
		customObject.deploymentStatus = 'Deployed';
		customObject.sharingModel = 'ReadWrite';
		MetadataService.AsyncResult[] results = service.create(new List<MetadataService.Metadata> { customObject });
	}
	
	public static void createField()
	{
		MetadataService.MetadataPort service = createService();		
		MetadataService.CustomField customField = new MetadataService.CustomField();
		customField.fullName = 'Test__c.TestField__c';
		customField.label = 'Test Field';
		customField.type_x = 'Text';
		customField.length = 42;
 		MetadataService.AsyncResult[] results = service.create(new List<MetadataService.Metadata> { customField });
	}

	public static void createPage()
	{
		MetadataService.MetadataPort service = createService();		
		MetadataService.ApexPage apexPage = new MetadataService.ApexPage();
		apexPage.apiVersion = 25;
		apexPage.fullName = 'test';
		apexPage.label = 'Test Page';
		apexPage.content = EncodingUtil.base64Encode(Blob.valueOf('<apex:page/>'));
 		MetadataService.AsyncResult[] results = service.create(new List<MetadataService.Metadata> { apexPage });
	}
	
	public static void listMetadata()
	{
		MetadataService.MetadataPort service = createService();		
		List<MetadataService.ListMetadataQuery> queries = new List<MetadataService.ListMetadataQuery>();		
		MetadataService.ListMetadataQuery queryWorkflow = new MetadataService.ListMetadataQuery();
		queryWorkflow.type_x = 'Workflow';
		queries.add(queryWorkflow);		
		MetadataService.ListMetadataQuery queryValidationRule = new MetadataService.ListMetadataQuery();
		queryValidationRule.type_x = 'ValidationRule';
		queries.add(queryValidationRule);		
		MetadataService.FileProperties[] fileProperties = service.listMetadata(queries, 25);
		for(MetadataService.FileProperties fileProperty : fileProperties)
			System.debug(fileProperty.fullName);
	}
	
	public static MetadataService.MetadataPort createService()
	{ 
		MetadataService.MetadataPort service = new MetadataService.MetadataPort();
		service.SessionHeader = new MetadataService.SessionHeader_element();
		service.SessionHeader.sessionId = UserInfo.getSessionId();
		return service;		
	}

Metadata Visualforce Demo
-------------------------

If you have an interactive tool your building, you can use Visualforce and use the **apex:actionPoller** to store the AsyncResult in your controller and write a controller method to call the checkStatus, which the action poller repeatedly calls until the AsyncResult indicates the request is completed by Salesforce. You can read more about this sample in this blog [here](http://andyinthecloud.com/2013/10/27/introduction-to-calling-the-metadata-api-from-apex/).

Metadata Batch Apex Demo
------------------------

As described above you can poll the checkStatus operation for completion via either apex:actionPoller or Batch Apex. This example code shows how to create a number of Metadata components (custom object, fields and a page) from Apex without requiring Visualforce. You can read more about it [here](http://andyinthecloud.com/2013/05/06/scripting-the-apex-metadata-api-and-batch-apex-support/)

		// Define Metadata item to create a Custom Object
		MetadataService.CustomObject customObject = new MetadataService.CustomObject();
		customObject.fullName = objectName + '__c';
		customObject.label = objectName;
		customObject.pluralLabel = objectName+'s';
		customObject.nameField = new MetadataService.CustomField();
		customObject.nameField.type_x = 'Text';
		customObject.nameField.label = 'Test Record';
		customObject.deploymentStatus = 'Deployed';
		customObject.sharingModel = 'ReadWrite';
		
		// Define Metadata item to create a Custom Field on the above object
		MetadataService.CustomField customField1 = new MetadataService.CustomField();
		customField1.fullName = objectName+'__c.TestField1__c';
		customField1.label = 'Test Field 1';
		customField1.type_x = 'Text';
		customField1.length = 42;

		// Define Metadata item to create a Custom Field on the above object
		MetadataService.CustomField customField2 = new MetadataService.CustomField();
		customField2.fullName = objectName+'__c.TestField2__c';
		customField2.label = 'Test Field 2';
		customField2.type_x = 'Text';
		customField2.length = 42;
		
		// Define Metadata item to create a Visualforce page to display the above field
		MetadataService.ApexPage apexPage = new MetadataService.ApexPage();
		apexPage.apiVersion = 25;
		apexPage.fullName = objectName.toLowercase();
		apexPage.label = objectName + ' Page';
		apexPage.content = EncodingUtil.base64Encode(Blob.valueOf(
			'<apex:page standardController=\''+objectName+'__c\'>'+
				'{!' + objectName + '__c.TestField1__c}' +
				'{!' + objectName + '__c.TestField2__c}' + 
			'</apex:page>'));
		
		// Pass the Metadata items to the job for processing, indicating any dependencies
		MetadataCreateJob.run(
			new List<MetadataCreateJob.Item> { 
					new MetadataCreateJob.Item(customObject),					
					new MetadataCreateJob.Item(customField1, null, true), // Set wait to true, to process after object creation
					new MetadataCreateJob.Item(customField2),  
					new MetadataCreateJob.Item(apexPage, null, true) // Set wait to true, to process after field creation
				},
			new MetadataCreateJob.EmailNotificationMetadataAsyncCallback());				


Metadata Retrieve Demo
----------------------

The [MetadataRetrieveController](https://github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi/blob/master/apex-mdapi/src/classes/MetadataRetrieveController.cls) and [metadataretrieve.page](https://github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi/blob/master/apex-mdapi/src/pages/metadataretrieve.page) samples demonstrate using the excellent [JSZip](http://stuartk.com/jszip/) library to handle the zip retrieve file contents. Passing the zip entries back to the controller for handling in Apex. This sample stores the file data in a list in the controller, though you could send or process the file anyway you see fit. It also shows how to handle the AsyncRequest and checkStatus calls. Enjoy and here is a screenshot!

![Metadata Retrieve Demo Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi/master/images/mdretrievedemo.png)

**NOTE:** I nearly got this working without using [JSZip](http://stuartk.com/jszip/), in a pure 100% native Apex and Visualforce way. I utilised the Metadata CRUD API to dynamically upload the zip file as a Static Resource. Then used PageReference.getContent to peak into it! However there seems to be a bug with Static Resources containing files with spaces in their names! No matter how I escapted the URL, I got a 404. I'm researching this further. So watch this space...

Metadata Deploy Demo
---------------------

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This demo allows you (in theory since I've not tested all) to deploy any Metadata Component types, including ApexClass. In many use cases it is possible to deploy Apex using the existing tools Salesforce provide, changesets, migration toolkit (aka Ant ) and packages. Only utilise this capability if your sure your use case requires it. Note that this does not bypass the need to deploy test code with the correct coverage when deploying into production environments.

The ability to deploy Apex code (and other Metadata component types not covered by the CRUD operations) is something it seems a lot of people have been asking about. Using the JSZip library I have got this working. I also decided to create some Visualforce components to wrap this library to make it a little easier to use. These components are called zip, zipEntry and unzip, you can see them in action on the pages used by this demo and the one above. 

To illustrate error handling, I've shown in the screen shot a deliberate failed deploy, since getting the feedback is just as an important aspect of the solution as a successful one! The key implementation parts of the sample are shown below, enjoy!

![Metadata Deploy Demo Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi/master/images/mddeploydemo.png)

	public String getPackageXml()
	{
		return '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>' + 
			'<Package xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">' + 
    			'<types>' + 
        			'<members>HelloWorld</members>' +
        			'<name>ApexClass</name>' + 
    			'</types>' + 
    			'<version>26.0</version>' + 
			'</Package>';		
	}
	
	public String getHelloWorldMetadata()
	{
		return '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>' +
			'<ApexClass xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">' +
			    '<apiVersion>26.0</apiVersion>' + 
			    '<status>Active</status>' +
			'</ApexClass>';		
	}

	public String getHelloWorld()	
	{
		return 'public class HelloWorld' + 
			'{' + 
				'public static void helloWorld()' +
				'{' + 
					'System.debug(\' Hello World\');' +
				'}' +
			'}';
	}

	<apex:actionFunction name="deployZip" action="{!deployZip}" rendered="{!ISNULL(AsyncResult)}" rerender="form">
		<apex:param name="data" assignTo="{!ZipData}" value=""/>
	</apex:actionFunction>

	<c:zip name="generateZip" oncomplete="deployZip(data);" rendered="{!ISNULL(AsyncResult)}">
		<c:zipEntry path="package.xml" data="{!PackageXml}"/>
		<c:zipEntry path="classes/HelloWorld.cls-meta.xml" data="{!HelloWorldMetadata}"/>
		<c:zipEntry path="classes/HelloWorld.cls" data="{!HelloWorld}"/>
	</c:zip>
	
	<input type="button" onclick="generateZip();" value="Deploy"/>

	public PageReference deployZip()
	{
		ApexPages.addMessage(new ApexPages.Message(ApexPages.Severity.Info, 'Deploying...'));

		// Deploy zip file posted back from the page action function				
		MetadataService.MetadataPort service = createService();
		MetadataService.DeployOptions deployOptions = new MetadataService.DeployOptions();
        deployOptions.allowMissingFiles = false;
        deployOptions.autoUpdatePackage = false;
        deployOptions.checkOnly = false;
        deployOptions.ignoreWarnings = false;
        deployOptions.performRetrieve = false;
        deployOptions.purgeOnDelete = false;
        deployOptions.rollbackOnError = true;
        deployOptions.runAllTests = false;
        deployOptions.runTests = null;
        deployOptions.singlePackage = true;		
		AsyncResult = service.deploy(ZipData, DeployOptions);				
		return null;
	}	

**NOTE:** I am using Visualforce state (aka Viewstate) and Visualforce AJAX in the above two examples. This will limit the size of the files and zip file being exchanged. Use of JavaScript Remoting will give you increased flexibility in file size (docs state a response size of 15MB is supported). However this will mean storing state in a Custom Object, the slight additional complexity of this I wanted to avoid in these samples. As noted below I have recently (December 2012) enhanced the zip components in another repo, they are based on those in this repo, so are fairly simple to retro fit, take a look at the samples there first. Finally, keep in mind that you can also for most other Metadata Component types use the CRUD operations as shown above, which avoid any zip file handling.

You can review the [MetadataDeployController](https://github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi/blob/master/apex-mdapi/src/classes/MetadataDeployController.cls) and [metadatadeploy.page](https://github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi/blob/master/apex-mdapi/src/pages/metadatadeploy.page) for the full code. I have also included some zip VF components. Starting from December 2012, I create a dedicated repo for zip handling [here](https://github.com/financialforcedev/apex-zip) so if your interested in these, please refer to this repo for the latest.

Metadata Explore Demo
---------------------

With my recent Sencha skills, I decided to see if I could start the roots of a Metadata Explorer tool, using the **describeMetadata** API call. I've commited the basics of it into the repo, here is a screenshot to give you an idea. It works by using Sencha Stores and the Tree control to incrementally load the tree as the user expands the Metadata Types, quite fun!

![Metadata Browse Demo Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi/master/images/mdbrowsedemo.png)

You can study the Visualforce page [here](https://github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi/blob/master/apex-mdapi/src/pages/metadatabrowser.page) which mostly contains the Sencha code, making use of the [metadatadata](https://github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi/blob/master/apex-mdapi/src/pages/metadatadata.page) page as a data proxy for the Sencha store. The controller for this data proxy page is [here](https://github.com/financialforcedev/apex-mdapi/blob/master/apex-mdapi/src/classes/MetadataDataController.cls). Which emits the JSON data (using calls to the describeMetadata API call) used by the Sencha store .

How to create your own MetadataService.cls
------------------------------------------

If you want to repeat what I did on new version of the Metadata WSDL or just want to tweak further component types beyond the ones used in the above examples. Here is how I did it...

     - Generating a valid Apex MetadataService class
          - Edit the WSDL
               - Change the Port name from 'Metadata' to 'MetadataPort'
               - As of Summer'13 (API 28) there was a small bug in the CustomField type definition, change the 'type' element definition to include a minOccurs="0" atttribute, as per the other elements in this type.
          - Attempt to generate Apex from this WSDL
               - Give it a better name if you want when prompted, e.g. MetadataService
               - In earlier platform releases this would error, as update and delete are reserved words.
               - It seems this has now been fixed and as of Summer'13 the Metadata API WSDL generates without errors!
          - Open Eclipse (or your favourite editor)
               - Open the class
               - To be compatible with the samples here, edit the method name update_x to updateMetadata
               - To be compatible with the samples here, edit the method name delete_x to deleteMetadata
               - To be compatible with the samples here, edit the method name retrieve_x to retrieve
               - Save the class
          - Update the MetadataServiceText class
               - Observe the uncovered items (new metadata operations, types added since last release)          
               - Add new code to cover operations and types
               - See this for guidelines http://andyinthecloud.com/2013/05/11/code-coverage-for-wsdl2apex-generated-classes
     - Making further edits to the Apex code
          - Modify the end point to be dynamic
               - public String endpoint_x = URL.getSalesforceBaseUrl().toExternalForm() + '/services/Soap/m/28.0';
          - Make 'Metadata' inner class 'virtual'
          - Make 'MetadataWithContent' inner class 'virtual'
          - Review WSDL for types that extend 'tns:Metadata' and update related Apex classes to also extend Metadata
          - Review WSDL for types that extend 'tns:MetadataWithContent' and update related Apex classes to also extend MetadataWithContent
          - Apply the following to each class that extends Metadata, e.g. for CustomObject
               Add the following at the top of the class
                    public String type = 'CustomObject';
                    public String fullName;
               Add the following at the top of the private static members
                    private String[] type_att_info = new String[]{'xsi:type'};
                    private String[] fullName_type_info = new String[]{'fullName','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema','string','0','1','false'};
               Add 'fullName' as the first item in the field_order_type_info String array, e.g.
                    private String[] field_order_type_info = new String[]{'fullName', 'actionOverrides' …. 'webLinks'};
          - Apply the following to each class that extends MetadataWithContent, e.g. for ApexPage
               Add the following after 'fullName'
                    public String content;
               Add the following after 'fullName_type_info'
                    private String[] content_type_info = new String[]{'content','http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema','base64Binary','0','1','false'};
               Add 'content' after 'fullName' in the field_order_type_info String array, e.g.
                    private String[] field_order_type_info = new String[]{'fullName', 'content', 'apiVersion','description','label','packageVersions'};
